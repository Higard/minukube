Commands used 

kubectl apply -f node-red-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f node-red-service.yaml
minikube service node-red-service --url

Before starting apllication and accesing it via ip and port addresses, after vm creation the site is unreachable(timeout) 
A few research in internet give me info about port forwarding in VirtualBox
So
1) Go to virtualbox app
2) find minikube VM
3) add new rule to forward port 1880 to port that minikube gives you after command
minikube service node-red-service --url

After this steps it should work properly(in my case it worked at least)
